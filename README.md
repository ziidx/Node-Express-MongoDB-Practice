# Workout Logger

Simple application that utilizes Node/Express and MongoDB for storing exercise logs for particular users. Based off this [Exercise Tracker Exercise](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)

Further expected changes include code refactoring and creating React interface in place of the current HTML template.
